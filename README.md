The main aim of the project to create a project that driven by tests by using cutting-edge technologies and following principles of software engineering. 
The API that I have created is called “Employee Management Tool” for managing employees in an organization. 
To develop this project, have created a CI/CD pipeline with IntellijIDE,GitHub, GitHubActions, Sonar Cloud, and Coveralls for code analysis, code coverage respectively. 
I have developed it while following TestDrivenDevelopment(TDD) methodology and SOLID principles of Java.
